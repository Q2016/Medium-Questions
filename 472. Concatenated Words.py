Question:
Given an array of strings words (without duplicates), return all the concatenated words in the given list of words.
A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array.

Example 1:
Input: words = ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]
Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]
Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
"dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
"ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".




Solution:

class Solution(object):
    def findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(self, words):

        d = set(words)
        
        def dfs(word):
            for i in range(1, len(word)):
                prefix = word[:i]
                suffix = word[i:]
                
                if prefix in d and suffix in d:
                    return True
                if prefix in d and dfs(suffix):
                    return True
                if suffix in d and dfs(prefix):
                    return True
            
            return False
        
        res = []
        for word in words:
            if dfs(word):
                res.append(word)
        
        return res
